# 📝 Todo App

Welcome to the **Todo App**! This project is a simple yet powerful to-do list application built using Vue 3 and Vite. It allows you to organize your tasks efficiently with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that you no longer need.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3:** The progressive JavaScript framework.
- **Vite:** Next Generation Frontend Tooling for fast builds.
- **ESLint:** A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## 🛠️ Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, it is recommended to use:

- [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A free and powerful code editor.
- [**Volar**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar): A VSCode extension that provides Vue 3 support. (Make sure to disable Vetur if you have it installed).

## 📝 Project Setup

Before you start developing, make sure to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## 👨‍💻 Development
To start the development server with hot-reloading (auto-refreshes your app when you save changes), use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Production Build
When you're ready to deploy your application, compile and minify the code for production:

```sh
npm run build
```
The compiled files will be in the `dist` directory, ready to be served by your preferred web server.

## 🧹 Code Linting
To maintain code quality, you can lint your code using ESLint:

```sh
npm run lint
```
This command will check your code for stylistic errors and potential issues, helping you maintain a clean codebase.

## 📚 Further Customization
For more detailed configuration and customization, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **Mark as Complete:** Easily mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Due Dates:** Add the ability to set due dates for tasks.
- **Categories:** Organize tasks by categories or tags.
- **Dark Mode:** Implement a dark mode for better accessibility.
- **Persistent Data:** All tasks are stored locally, so your list remains even after refreshing the page.
